    cy.visit('/api/resource');
    cy.contains('Resource data');
  });
});
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This microservices and Node.js book is for backend developers, full-stack developers, software architects, and frontend developers who want to venture into the world of backend development and extend their capabilities. A fundamental understanding of the JavaScript ecosystem will be helpful but not necessary, as this book will cover the essentials of backend development, JavaScript programming, and Node.js.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-16).
